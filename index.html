            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi, I'm Eric Delgado! I am an MIT '26 from Milwaukee, Wisconsin 
                studying Mechanical Engineering and concentrating in Robotics. 
                Current academic interests include: bionic prosthetics, automobiles, 
                and machine learning.</p>
            <p>I enjoy hands-on projects, from woodworking 
                to Arduino and everything in between. I love being active and 
                in nature - running, cycling, lifting, and hiking are some of my favorite 
                ways to destress! Watching fast cars on TV is my peak entertainment.  
                Look around to learn more about me and what I do.</p>
